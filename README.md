# 🍪 Dotfiles

Hi! Here are the dotfiles of my Linux installation, I hope you'll like them!

Made with <a href="https://github.com/Biscuit-Theme">Biscuit Color Scheme</a>.

⚠️ The included firefox theme is a mix of two themes, <a href="https://github.com/KiKaraage/ArcWTF/">ArcWTF</a> and <a href="https://github.com/datguypiko/Firefox-Mod-Blur?tab=readme-ov-file">Firefox Mod Blur</a>, but lacks support of sidebar
